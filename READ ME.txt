
1 - Files Description
There are 4 main files:
	*./src/sql_mng.py: file containing database management functions
	*./src/scraper.py: file containg scraping function
	*./src/main.py: file containing the main instructions of the app
	*./src/test.py: file for testing

2 - Usage:
I couldn't get the app to be as user-friendly as possible, so exectuion of the main.py commands is a little 	unconventional.
	1 - Open a terminal at the folder containing main.py

	2 - In the terminal, run the following Fast API command: uvicorn main:app --reload

	3 - The number of messages will appear on the terminal. Wait for the following message:
	"INFO: Application startup complete."

	4 - Access or refresh the following url in your default browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

	5 - The user input fields will appear, enter the facebook page, number of desired scrolls 
	and the type of table you want to return (posts or comments? case sensitive)

	6 - A few warnings will appear, but they can be ignored

	7 - The browser tab will finally load a page containing the desired table.


The final result could have been better, 
but due to various constraints, this is as far was I was able to get for the time being.
